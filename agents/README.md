# Claude Agents

This directory contains agent implementations built using Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK. Each agent is designed to handle specific tasks and demonstrates different patterns of AI agent orchestration and automation.

## Available Agents

**[Auto Coder](./agent-auto-coder/README.md)**: An experimental tool that leverages the Claude Agent SDK to automatically generate code based on user requirements. It operates in non-interactive mode (YOLO mode) in a sandboxed environment, making it suitable for automated workflows.

**[Meeting Summarizer](./meeting-summarizer/README.md)**: An automated workflow system that uses AI agents to download, organize, and summarize meeting transcripts from Fathom. Demonstrates multi-agent orchestration with a planning agent that creates workflow plans executed by specialized agents.

## Getting Started
Please refer to the individual agent README files for detailed information on installation, configuration, and usage.
